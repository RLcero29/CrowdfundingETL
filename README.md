This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for crowdfunding data. The objective of this project is to extract data from a given source, transform it as needed, and load it into a database. The project also includes analyzing and querying the crowdfunding data. The result of this project is a database that houses the different companies that have launched a crowdfunding campaign, complete with information such as contact info, the description of the company, and whether or not the crowdfunding was successful.
We extracted Excel data and created 3 different dataframes (Category/Subcategory, Campaign, Contacts) and transformed the data by renaming columns and converting data types. For the Contacts dataframe specifically, we used regex commands to clean and transform the dataframe into a more readable document showing with 4 columns. We would then merge 2 of the dataframes (Category/Subcategory and Campaign). After cleaning and transforming, we would export these dataframes into 4 separate CSV files. We also would create a database using PostgreSQL from an ERD schema that we sketched to help guide our primary key and foreign key designations for each table. From the creation of the database, we imported the different CSV files into the appropriate tables and then ran a SELECT * statement to verify that the files were added correctly.
